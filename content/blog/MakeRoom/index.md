For the Ludum Dare 54 Game Jam, I designed and programmed a soft-body physics puzzle game in 72 Hours.

Though this wasn't my first gam jam project, it is the one I am most proud of. I'm no stranger to short development cycles - I've participated in several game jams and even most of my longer projects have a development time frame of 1-3 months. However, for this project I feel like I was able to appropriately scope my design, and deliver a reasonable amount of content.

The theme of the game jam was "Limited Space", and prior to the jam I had already wanted to experiment with a soft-body physics plugin for Godot that I had found. The unique properties of this physics plugin allowed me to provide a unique take on a 'jigsaw puzzle' design, where the amount of 'pieces' exceeded the allocated space to place them into. I wanted to preserve the 'fun' of the soft-body physics, which in my opinion is always related to squishing and stretching the jelly-like objects and being able to freely play with them. Because of that inherent fun factor, I felt that I could have a little leeway with the rigidity of the controls, as the expectation of any physics-driven game is that it is hard to control (i.e. Getting Over It). I was also able to add a decent amount of polish, such as having the blocks make noises and change their expressions when tossed around, encouraging the player to use the physics sandbox for play rather than just achieve the goal of the puzzle.

## Reflection

In retrospect, I think there are some small quality-of-life improvements that I could have easily added that would have massively improved the design and user experience. A simple progress meter that indicated how close the player was to 'fitting' into the container would have been a huge improvement in clarity, and very easy given that I was already tracking that value. Overall though, I am proud of the end result of the game, especially the fact that I was able to design a dozen sequential levels within the game jam time frame. I am also really proud of the ranking the game achieved, with a rank of 209th overall out of 1597 entries, with a rank of 22nd(!!) in the "Theme" category, and 87th in "Humor" as well as top 10% in both fun and innovation.
