In my internship and co-op at Brunwick's BI (Boating Intelligence) Design Lab, I helped create an immersive simulation to showcase the future of boating at Consumer Electronics Show 2025.

## Project Overview

I was part of the Computer Graphics team at the BI Design Lab, and our primary task for the spring and summer was to develop an interactive futuristic boating experience using Unreal Engine 5. More specifically, we focused on creating an interactive HMI that would interface with physical boat hardware, and a visualization of the boat's surroundings. The core UI was developed with Epic's CommonUI plugin, and we made use of Unreal Motion Graphics to polish the experience.

I also had the opportunity to travel to CES 2025 as an exhibitor for Brunswick, where I helped showcase the simulator to thousands of people, including investors, media, and other members of the industry. Our experience was also featured on a variety of news outlets.

This was my first role as a developer on a large-scale Unreal Engine project, and it was interesting to learn about the different considerations taken into account for a physical full-scale demonstration as opposed to traditional game development with the engine.

## Responsibilities

- Collaborated with the UI/UX Designers and artists to translate their visual layouts and planned interactions from Figma to Unreal using the Common UI plugin, UMG, C++, and Blueprint Scripting.
- Developed and maintained a platform-agnostic communication protocol that used WebSockets to share data wirelessly accross multiple PCs, Android displays, and various microcontrollers, with a python-based server and C++-based UE5 Client.
- Helped translate our custom UI components and frameworks into a plugin that could be utilized in future UI development projects.
- Evaluated new tools for UI design such as the RIVE plugin, reporting performance and compatibility concerns.
- Prototyped new features and mechanics with C++ and Blueprint scripting, evaluating similarity to real-life physics and intuitivity when integrated with unconventional control schemes
- Created and managed weekly Windows and Android builds with latest features.
- Showcased simulator to booth attendees at CES 2025.
