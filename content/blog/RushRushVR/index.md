For the final project of my VR Game Development course, I teamed up with several developers to create a small VR microgame collection.

My project group for this VR game development course had great chemistry and were all knowledgeable hard workers, but we were also all programmers. We wanted a game concept that could allow us to work to our strengths rather than sacrificing considerable time to the art direction of finding cohesive assets.

I proposed an idea that would allow us to not only provide a polished experience, but also would allow for our workflow to be unimpeded by varying schedules and level of time commitment. By creating a microgame collection (WarioWare was our primary inspiration), each member could be wholly responsible for their portion of the project without being blocked, any art assets we used wouldn't have to match, and we would each get a chance to experience all aspects of VR game creation - the game design, sound design, art direction, and interaction programming.

My group members weren't very familiar with WarioWare when I proposed the idea, so we conducted an evaluation of many of nintendo's microgames and devised some core design rules. Our microgames were to generally focus on one action, should have a goal that is conveyed clearly with a short phrase, have around 5-10 seconds of gameplay, and only make use of one button on the controller. By following these design guidelines, we were able to make our independently developed microgames come together as a cohesive experience that was both intuitive and addicting.

## Responsibilities

- Coceptualized the core design principles and game flow of a VR microgame collection, including scoring, difficulty scaling, and interaction design guardrails
- Created two complete microgames in their entirety, including designing and programming core mechanics and gameplay, designing difficulty scaling and timing parameters, and compiling assets to create a level layout
- Playtested and adjusted mechanics and difficulty based on feedback from users
- Created Android builds that would be run on Meta Quest 2 hardware
