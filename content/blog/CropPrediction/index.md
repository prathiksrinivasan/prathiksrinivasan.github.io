In my 2022 Summer Internship with Connectivia Labs, I created a Machine Learning model to predict the ideal crop given a collection of climate and environmental data.

## Project Overview

For this internship, I was working with a local Austin, TX startup company as a Machine Learning intern. The company's goal was to create a combined hardware-software solution that could monitor climate and environmental data such as soil composition and rainfall at range, without relying on connection systems like LTE. They also wanted to showcase the ability to store this data in the cloud and perform analytics, which is what I was tasked with demonstrating.

I created and trained a TensorFlow based deep learning model to predict optimal crop patterns based on this data, as well as a system to draw from a local MongoDB instance to run model inferences. Using Docker, I containerized this collective data management and analysis solution, allowing it to demonstrate an ofline analytics system that could interface with long-range communication protocols.
