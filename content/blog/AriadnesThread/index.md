I worked with a as the Programming Lead on a team with 20+ other developers as part of UIUC GameBuilders, creating a procedurally generated horror game over the course of a semester.

## Project Overview

[Project Link](https://gamebuilders-studio.itch.io/adriadnes-blessing)

This project was my first time working with a team of more than 3 or 4 other developers, and also my first time in a leadership position for a programming role. The entire programming team consisted of about 6 other developers, with some members of the art and design teams also assisting with some scripting and tech art tasks. As the programming lead, I had to constantly communicate with the design lead, translating intended behaviors into modular and separable tasks for different team members to work on. In this lead position, I learned a lot about efficiently reviewing code, programming modular mechanics, and being aware of blocking tasks during production.

The biggest difference between this and most other projects I've worked on is that I can't say that there is any single feature I am 'responsible' for programming - I played a support and leadership role for the rest of the development team's work, reviewing and improving their code and occasionally refactoring elements as new features were added. I contributed to the procedural level generation, enemy AI behavior, UI programming, and player controller.

## Responsibilities

- Managed a team of 6+ programmers to develop mechanics for a first-person horror game with Unity and C#
- Reviewed and approved pull requests for new features
- Organized weekly standup meetings to review progress and assign new tasks
- Compiled bug reports and refactor requests
